# Algorithms and data structures

This repository contains implementation of different algorithms and data structures in C++ and C.

### Data structures

All data structures are in the `structures` directory. Below is the list of implemented structures.
More documentation and list of methods you can hopefully find in source code.

| Class name | Source file  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gush::DList<T>` | [DList.h](structures/DList.h) | Doubly-linked list |
| `gush::Vector<T>` | [Vector.h](structures/Vector.h) | Dynamic array |
| `gush::ArrayStack<T>` | [ArrayStack.h](structures/ArrayStack.h) | Stack based on array |
| `gush::ArrayDeque<T>` | [ArrayDeque.h](structures/ArrayDeque.h) | Deque based on array |
| `gush::SkiplistSet<T>` | [SkiplistSet.h](structures/SkiplistSet.h) | Set implemented with skiplist |
