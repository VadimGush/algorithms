# Algorithms and data structures

This repository contains implementation of different algorithms and data structures in C++.

### Data structures

Below is the list of implemented structures. Don't use them anywhere. They're not safe and not properly tested.

| Class name | Source file  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DList<T>` | [DList.h](source/DList.h) | Doubly-linked list |
| `vector<T>` | [vector.h](source/vector.h) | Dynamic array |
| `ArrayStack<T>` | [ArrayStack.h](source/ArrayStack.h) | Stack based on array |
| `ArrayDeque<T>` | [ArrayDeque.h](source/ArrayDeque.h) | Deque based on array |
| `skiplist_set<T>` | [skiplist_set.h](source/skiplist_set.h) | Set implemented with skiplist |
| `BlockStorage<T>` | [BlockStorage.h](source/BlockStorage.h) | Linked list for storing blocks of binary data |
